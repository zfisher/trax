  """Base class for optimizers that work hand in hand with Trax layers.

  To define an optimizer subclass, specify its behavior with respect to a
  single level/node in the network (e.g., a single dense layer):

    - `init`: how to create/initialize optimizer-internal weights ("slots")
        whose shape matches the node's weight shape.
    - `update`: how to use gradient information to update node weights and
        optimizer slots.

  The Trax runtime combines these node-local computations into weight updates
  and slot updates for the whole tree of layers in the model.
